Daniel CJ here. 

I'm an honest digital technology ethusiast, currently lurking in the mobile development world, mainly flutter and a sprinkle of java/kotlin. I also do scripting with Python either for automation or destroying Operating Systems.

There's not much interesting thing about me as a person. I just like learning something new because I find it entertaining and addicting.
